          2024 has been a good year. I decided to get married next year. I got a
          new tattoo.

          I manage to take 7 trips. I went snowboarding, I switched from ski to
          snowboard in 2023, in Les Arcs, France, in January. Then in March I
          went to Italy to spend a bit of time with my mum for her birthday. In
          April I went to Barcelona, Spain, to do some work with my team. I went
          back to Barcelona in May for
          <a href="https://www.primaverasound.com">Primavera Sound festival</a>.
          In June I visited for the first time in my life Montenegro for a
          relaxing summer holiday. In October I was lucky enough to spend two
          weeks in Japan travelling around between Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka for
          the trip of my life so far. I went back to Italy before the end of the
          year in November to show Rome to my partner's family
        </p>

          Talking about media consumption I listened to a lot of music, 13667
          songs to be precise. Only in 2008 I listened to more music! I read 5
          books, 4 of them were audiobooks. I watched 28 seasons of various TV
          shows, the best one was probably
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_(American_TV_series)"
            >The Curse</a
          >. I also watched 36 films, of which only 2 of them in the cinema. I
          have already booked 2 cinema trips for January, so hopefully more
          films in the cinema in 2025. In 2024 the best film I watched was by
          far
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zone_of_Interest_(film)"
            >The Zone of Interest</a
          >.

          Healthwise was a great year. I managed to lose 3kg and set my PB
          running
          <a href="https://www.hackneymoves.com/">Hackney Half</a> in 01:49:06
          in May, just two weeks after setting my PB doing a solo
          <a href="https://www.hyrox.com">Hyrox</a> finishing it in 01:44:37. In
          general I trained a lot. I ran 400km in 2024, that is more than double
          the average distance ran in previous years and I also did 40 strenght
          training sessions mainly using
          <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com">Peloton</a> strength classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the most of London trying out 15 new restaurants. The best meal
          was for sure at
          <a href="https://www.napoliontheroad.co.uk/">Napoli on the Road</a>. I
          went to the theatre 5 times, the best show was probably
          <a href="https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/roots/">Roots</a>. I also went
          to 19 gigs in London, with
          <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2024/event/sunn-o"
            >SUNN O)))</a
          >
          being the best one.
